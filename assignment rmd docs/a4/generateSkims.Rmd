## script overview

This Rmd doc contains the scripts to generate travel skims.
We will be doing skims for the following modes: car, transit, pedestrian, bicycle.
We also will be running transit skims for 3 times of day:
8:15, 12:30, and 17:15, to correspond to the morning and evening rushes,
plus a mid-day travel time.
