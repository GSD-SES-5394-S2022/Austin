## script overview

This Rmd doc contains the scripts to generate travel skims.
We will be doing skims for the following modes: car, transit, pedestrian, bicycle.
We also will be running transit skims for 3 times of day:
8:15, 12:30, and 17:15, to correspond to the morning and evening rushes,
plus a mid-day travel time.

Our chosen date for the skim is Wednesday, April 6, 2022.

```{r load libraries}
# allocate more memory to Java for using r5r
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx2G")
library(r5r)

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r setup r5 core}
existing_core <- here("existing",
                      "networks") %>%
  setup_r5(verbose = FALSE)
```
