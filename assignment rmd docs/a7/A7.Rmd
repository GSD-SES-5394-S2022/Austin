```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```{r load libraries}

First we need to bring in our National Household Travel Survey data.
(Obtained from https://nhts.ornl.gov/)

We already filtered the complete dataset to only Austin data, so it could
fit on our Github repo.
(See adjacent "A7 get only austin data.rmd")

```{r bring in NHTS data}
austin_trips <- read_csv(here(
                        "assignment rmd docs",
                        "a7",
                        "austin_trips.csv"))

austin_hhs <- read_csv(here(
                      "assignment rmd docs",
                      "a7",
                      "austin_hhs.csv"))
```
